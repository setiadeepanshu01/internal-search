# Enterprise Search Chatbot with RAG

This enterprise-grade application integrates Elasticsearch, Langchain, and various Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver a sophisticated chatbot experience powered by ELSER, utilizing your proprietary data.

## Getting Started
### Locally (for development)

With the environment variables set, you can run the following commands to start the server and frontend.

#### Pre-requisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node 14+

#### Install the dependencies

For Python we recommend using a virtual environment.

```sh
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Node dependencies
cd frontend && yarn && cd ..
```



#### Run API and frontend

```sh
# Launch API app
flask run

# In a separate terminal launch frontend app
cd frontend && yarn start
```

You can now access the frontend at http://localhost:3000. Changes are automatically reloaded.
